                            <p>Hack is a programming language for the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM), created by Facebook
                                as a dialect of PHP.The language implementation is open-source, licensed under the MIT License.
                                Hack allows programmers to use both dynamic typing and static typing. This kind of a type system
                                is called gradual typing, which is also implemented in other programming languages such as ActionScript.
                                Hack's type system allows types to be specified for function arguments, function return values, and class properties;
                                however, types of local variables are always inferred and cannot be specified.
                                Using Visual Studio Code with the VSCode-Hack extension, provides standard
                                 IDE-like features such as syntax highlighting, go-to-definition,
                                  and in-line display of Hack errors.</p>

                            <p>Pysa is a security-focused tool built on top of our type checker for Python, Pyre.
                                 It’s used to look at code and analyze how data flows through it. Analyzing data 
                                  flows is useful because many security and privacy issues can be modeled as data 
                                  flowing into a place it shouldn’t.
                                Pysa helps us detect a wide range of issues.
                                 For example, we use it to check whether our Python code properly makes use of certain
                                  internal frameworks, which are designed to prevent access to, or disclosure of,
                                   user data based on technical privacy policies. Pysa also detects common web app security issues,
                                    like XSS and SQL injection.</p>
